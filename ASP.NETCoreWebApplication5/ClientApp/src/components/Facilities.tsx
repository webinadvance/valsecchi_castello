                    The strong connection between the water and Villa Pliniana has been enhanced during renovation works
                    of
                    2015 by adding a spa. The new spa is located on a terrace above the garden and entirely occupies a
                    dedicated building. The infinity pool gives the beautiful illusion of swimming in the middle of the
                    lake. The swimming pool is actually supplied with water filtered and conveyed from the lake at fifty
                    meters depth. The Wellness center of Villa Pliniana also offers sauna, steam bath and emotional
                    showers
                    with comfortable locker rooms.
